# Intruder-Detector

This software is an example of a smart home system. The intruder detector takes a picture of a particular object/person when it detects movement in a particular location. The following implementation is done through a motion sensor, a camera and GPIO pins. Once detected, the user is notified that there has been an intruder via email. This model is based on a Raspberry Pi Model 4B.
